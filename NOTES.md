Notes on future work
====================

# Possible items
- Subsonic/navidrome/plex streaming support
- Replace libcaca with something that
  - avoids a C library dependency
  - supports truecolor terminals
- Actually testing non-Linux platforms

# Unlikely items
- Significant cover art fetching improvements
  - Just use https://beets.io and its plugins

# Discarded ideas
- Using magic to identify playable files
  - Doesn't scale over network filesystems
